# Data Cleaning with Python Pandas ESPN Dataset 

## Project Description

In this project we used Python Pandas to clean up data and answer some questions about 'Highest career batting average in Tests (ESPN)' dataset. We started by cleaning our data. Then we explored 5  questions related to our data:
<ol>
  <li>What is the Average Career Length?</li>
  <li>AVG batting strike rate for cricketers who played over 10 years</li>
  <li>Find number of cricketers who played before 1960</li>
  <li>Max highest inns score by country</li>
  <li>Hundreds (100), fifties (50), ducks (0) AVG by country</li>
</ol>
